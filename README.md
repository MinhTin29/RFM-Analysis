# RFM-Analysis

## Why RFM?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing model using customer segmentation based on their transaction history.
This model could be very useful, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited marketing resources, helping them focus on the potentially right customer segments to increase ROI, reduce churn, reduce cost, improve customer relationship, and a lot more.
## How?
In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores.

# Business Problem
**SuperStore Company** is a global retail company - Global. So the company has many customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers who have supported the company over the past time. As well as exploiting customers who have the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like in previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in implementing a classification problem. Segment each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also suggested using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so we want the Data Department to build a flow to deploy Segmentation evaluation through Python programming.

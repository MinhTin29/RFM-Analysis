# RFM-Analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much the customer spends (Monetary).

**Recency(R):** Customers who purchased more recently are more likely to purchase again than are customers who purchased further in the past.

**Frequency(F):** Customers who have made more purchases in the past are more likely to respond than who have made fewer purchases.

**Monetary:** Customers who have spent more (in total for all purchases) in the past are more likely to respond than those who have spent less.

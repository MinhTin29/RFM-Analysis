# RFM-Analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much the customer spends (Monetary).

**Recency(R):** Customers who purchased more recently are more likely to purchase again than are customers who purchased further in the past.

**Frequency(F):** Customers who have made more purchases in the past are more likely to respond than who have made fewer purchases.

**Monetary:** Customers who have spent more (in total for all purchases) in the past are more likely to respond than those who have spent less.

# Business Problem
**SuperStore Company** is a global retail company - Global. So the company has many customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers who have supported the company over the past time. As well as exploiting customers who have the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like in previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in implementing a classification problem. Segment each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also suggested using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so we want the Data Department to build a flow to deploy Segmentation evaluation through Python programming.
